## Overview

No clutter. No intrusive elements. Just content.

## Design Philosophy

This project follows a **less-is-more** approach:

- No credit popups  
- No visual noise  
- No forced animations  

Everything is intentional and restrained, ensuring the app feels calm, polished, and professional.
